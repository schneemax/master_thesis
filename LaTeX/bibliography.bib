Abstract = {The number of mobile apps launched in the market has exponentially grown to more than 2 million, but little is known about how users choose and consume apps of numerous categories. This study develops a utility theory-based structural model for mobile app analytics. We use the theoretical concepts of utility and satiation along with the factor analytic approach, as bases in simultaneously modeling the complex relationships among choice, consumption, and utility maximization for consumers of various mobile apps. Using a unique panel dataset detailing individual user-level mobile app time consumption, we quantify the baseline utility and satiation levels of diverse mobile apps and delineate how app preferences and consumption patterns vary across demographic groups affected by persistent use and time trends. The findings suggest that users’ baseline utility substantially diverges across app categories and that their demographic characteristics and habit formation explain the appreciable},

Abstract = {In the past few years, big data has attracted significant attention, and many analytics platforms, such as Hadoop, have been developed to enable the analysis of massive data. Nevertheless, it is still very challenging to provision, let alone optimize, a comprehensive system that includes various aspects, from the computing infrastructure to the analytics programs. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose a novel provisioning framework, BigProvision, to provision big data analytics systems. The main idea of the framework is to first evaluate and model the performance of different big data analytics approaches, given a set of sample data and various analytics requirements, such as the expected results, budget, response time, and so on. Based on the evaluation and modeling results, BigProvision can generate a provisioning configuration that can be used to configure the whole system for big data analytics. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we develop an e},

Abstract = {In the current data-driven digital economy, organizations attempt to harness big data power to make their decisions better. The big data analytics assist them not only to identify new opportunities but extract knowledge and obtain better performance. Despite a huge investment in big data analytics initiatives, the majority of organizations have failed to successfully exploit their power. Although big data analytics have received considerable research attention, a little has been done on how organizations implement strategies in order to integrate the different dimensions of big data analytics; hence, a roadmap is required to navigate these technological initiatives. This paper is also an attempt to overcome this challenge by developing a comprehensive big data analytics maturity model to help managers evaluate their existing capabilities and formulate an appropriate strategy for further progress. A mixed-method was applied in this research using a qualitative meta-synthesis approach. },

Abstract = {Addressing consistent and reliable decision-making are crucial activities when choosing seemingly related alternatives for a set of criteria. Models and methods for aiding decisions such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were developed to handle quantified assessments of quality attributes, usually intangible and numerically hard to cope. We introduce the Decisor software tool to assist the use of AHP to drive complex decision modeling. We present a study of related tools describing advantages and drawbacks. The tool is user friendly, with intuitive data entry fields. Users may input alternatives and criteria, assigning weights from different judgment scales. Decisor's main characteristic is its simple interface where the tool computes priority vectors for all alternatives and its consistency rates. It is also possible to operate with negative weighting, inferring Benefits, Opportunities, Costs, and Risks. The tool implements Group Decisions, using the geometric mean to combine crit},

Abstract = {Data analytics has become an increasingly eye-catching practice in both the academic and the business communities. The importance of data analytics has also prompted growing literature to focus on the design of data analytics. However, the boundary conditions for data analytics in creating value have been largely overlooked in the literature. The objective of this article therefore is to examine the business value of data analytics usage and explore how such value differs in different market conditions. We rely on an online B2C platform as our empirical setting and obtain several important insights. First, both demand-side and supply-side data analytics usage has a positive effect on the performance of merchants. Second, when merchants’ product variety is high, the influence of usage toward demand-side data on performance is strengthened, whereas such impact is weakened for supply-side data analytics. Third, when competitive intensity is high, the performance implication of demand-sid},

Abstract = {The popularity of the big data domain has boosted corporate interest in collecting and storing tremendous amounts of consumers' textual information. However, decision makers are often overwhelmed by the abundance of information, and the usage of text mining (TM) tools is still at its infancy. This study validates an extended technology acceptance model integrating information quality (IQ) and top management support. Results confirm that IQ influences behavioral intentions and TM tools usage, through perceptions of external control, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness; top management support also has a key role in determining the usage of TM tools.

Abstract = {Prior research has confirmed the importance of IT-business alignment (ITBA) and big data analytics capability (BDAC) in supporting firms' strategic decision-making under normal circumstances. However, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly changed firms' strategic decision-making landscapes and raised questions regarding the effects of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision-making as conditioned by COVID-19 characteristics. In this study, we contextualize two important event impact factors (i.e., event criticality and event disruption) in the context of COVID-19 and examine their contingent roles in the effects of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision-making. Our analyses, based on two-round, multi-respondents matched survey data collected from 175 Chinese firms to elucidate the differential moderating roles of event criticality and disruption of COVID-19 in the impact of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision speed and quality. The results indicate the event criticality of COVID-1},

Abstract = {Agility, which refers to a dynamic capability within firms to identify and effectively respond to threats and opportunities with speed, is considered as a main business imperative in modern business environments. While there is some evidence that information technology (IT) capabilities can help organizations to be more agile, studies have reported mixed findings regarding such effects. In this study, we identify the conditions under which IT capabilities translate into agility gains. We focus on a specific and critical IT capability, the use of data analytics, which is often leveraged by firms to improve decision making and achieve agility gains. We leverage dynamic capability theory to understand the influence of data analytics use as a lower-order dynamic capability on firm agility as a higher-order dynamic capability. We also draw on the fit perspective to suggest that this impact will only accrue if there is a high degree of fit between several elements that are closely related t},

Abstract = {Big data analytics (BDA) are gaining importance in all aspects of business management. This is driven by both the presence of large-scale data and management's desire to root decisions in data. Extant research demonstrates that supply chain and operations management functions are among the biggest sources and users of data in the company. Therefore, their decision-making processes would benefit from increased use of BDA technologies. However, there is still a lack of understanding of what determines a company's ability to build BDA capability to gain a competitive advantage. In this study, we attempt to answer this fundamental question by identifying the factors that assist a company in or inhibit it from building its BDA capability and maximizing its gains through BDA technologies. We base our findings on a qualitative analysis of data collected from field visits, interviews with senior management, and secondary resources. We find that, in addition to technical capacity, competitive },

Abstract = {Despite continuous investment in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in technology standards, the total amount of road traffic accidents has been increasing over the last decades. Consequently, identifying ways of effectively reducing the frequency and severity of traffic accidents is of utmost importance. In light of the depicted challenge, latest studies provide promising evidence that in-vehicle decision support systems (DSSs) can have significant positive effects on driving behaviour and collision avoidance. Going beyond existing research, we developed a comprehensive in-vehicle DSS, which provides accident hotspot warnings to drivers based on location analytics applied to a national historical accident dataset, composed of over 266,000 accidents. As such, we depict the design and field evaluation of an in-vehicle DSS, bridging the gap between real world location analytics and in-vehicle warnings.

Abstract = {Abstract: Personalized marketing via mobile devices, also known as Mobile Personalized Marketing (MPM), has become an increasingly important marketing tool because the ubiquity, interactivity and localization of mobile devices offers great potential for understanding customers' preferences and quickly advertising customized products or services. A tremendous challenge in MPM is to factor a mobile user's context into the prediction of the user's preferences. This paper proposes a novel framework with a three-stage procedure to discover the correlation between contexts of mobile users and their activities for better predicting customers' preferences. Our framework helps not only to discover sequential rules from contextual data, but also to overcome a common barrier in mining contextual data, i.e. elimination of redundant rules that occur when multiple dimensions of contextual information are used in the prediction. The effectiveness of our framework is evaluated through experiments con},

A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test controlled study was conducted in a large medical system in the eastern United States. Healthcare data analytics training program participants (N = 21) and a comparison group comprising trainee-identified peers completing comparable work (N = 27) were compared at the start of training and one year later. Results showed that both trainees and peers demonstrated improved healthcare data analytics skills over time, related to concomitant increases in their healthcare data analytics-related learning and performance goals. This study suggests that healthcare organizations aiming at successfully implementing a new data analytics infrastructure should provide well-designed training that enables trainees to develop specific learning and performance goals as well as improve relevant skills and ability to use new tools.},

 abstract = {Due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, higher education institutions are challenged to continue providing quality teaching, consulting, and research production through virtual education environments. In this context, a large volume of data is being generated, and technologies such as big data analytics are needed to create opportunities for open innovation by obtaining valuable knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of big data analytics and evaluate the relationship it has with performance and knowledge management, taking into consideration that this technology is in its initial stages and that previous research has provided varied results depending on the sector in focus. To address these challenges, a theoretical framework is developed to empirically test the relationship of these variables; 265 members of universities in Latin America were surveyed, and structural equation modeling is used. The findings identify compatibility, an adequate organizational data environment, and external support as factors required to adopt big data analytics, and their positive relationship is tested with knowledge management processes and organizational performance. This study provides practical guidance for decision-makers involved in or in charge of defining the implementation strategy of big data analytics in higher education institutions.},
