Abstract = {The number of mobile apps launched in the market has exponentially grown to more than 2 million, but little is known about how users choose and consume apps of numerous categories. This study develops a utility theory-based structural model for mobile app analytics. We use the theoretical concepts of utility and satiation along with the factor analytic approach, as bases in simultaneously modeling the complex relationships among choice, consumption, and utility maximization for consumers of various mobile apps. Using a unique panel dataset detailing individual user-level mobile app time consumption, we quantify the baseline utility and satiation levels of diverse mobile apps and delineate how app preferences and consumption patterns vary across demographic groups affected by persistent use and time trends. The findings suggest that users’ baseline utility substantially diverges across app categories and that their demographic characteristics and habit formation explain the appreciable},

Abstract = {In the past few years, big data has attracted significant attention, and many analytics platforms, such as Hadoop, have been developed to enable the analysis of massive data. Nevertheless, it is still very challenging to provision, let alone optimize, a comprehensive system that includes various aspects, from the computing infrastructure to the analytics programs. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose a novel provisioning framework, BigProvision, to provision big data analytics systems. The main idea of the framework is to first evaluate and model the performance of different big data analytics approaches, given a set of sample data and various analytics requirements, such as the expected results, budget, response time, and so on. Based on the evaluation and modeling results, BigProvision can generate a provisioning configuration that can be used to configure the whole system for big data analytics. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we develop an e},

Abstract = {In the current data-driven digital economy, organizations attempt to harness big data power to make their decisions better. The big data analytics assist them not only to identify new opportunities but extract knowledge and obtain better performance. Despite a huge investment in big data analytics initiatives, the majority of organizations have failed to successfully exploit their power. Although big data analytics have received considerable research attention, a little has been done on how organizations implement strategies in order to integrate the different dimensions of big data analytics; hence, a roadmap is required to navigate these technological initiatives. This paper is also an attempt to overcome this challenge by developing a comprehensive big data analytics maturity model to help managers evaluate their existing capabilities and formulate an appropriate strategy for further progress. A mixed-method was applied in this research using a qualitative meta-synthesis approach. },

Abstract = {Addressing consistent and reliable decision-making are crucial activities when choosing seemingly related alternatives for a set of criteria. Models and methods for aiding decisions such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were developed to handle quantified assessments of quality attributes, usually intangible and numerically hard to cope. We introduce the Decisor software tool to assist the use of AHP to drive complex decision modeling. We present a study of related tools describing advantages and drawbacks. The tool is user friendly, with intuitive data entry fields. Users may input alternatives and criteria, assigning weights from different judgment scales. Decisor's main characteristic is its simple interface where the tool computes priority vectors for all alternatives and its consistency rates. It is also possible to operate with negative weighting, inferring Benefits, Opportunities, Costs, and Risks. The tool implements Group Decisions, using the geometric mean to combine crit},

Abstract = {Data analytics has become an increasingly eye-catching practice in both the academic and the business communities. The importance of data analytics has also prompted growing literature to focus on the design of data analytics. However, the boundary conditions for data analytics in creating value have been largely overlooked in the literature. The objective of this article therefore is to examine the business value of data analytics usage and explore how such value differs in different market conditions. We rely on an online B2C platform as our empirical setting and obtain several important insights. First, both demand-side and supply-side data analytics usage has a positive effect on the performance of merchants. Second, when merchants’ product variety is high, the influence of usage toward demand-side data on performance is strengthened, whereas such impact is weakened for supply-side data analytics. Third, when competitive intensity is high, the performance implication of demand-sid},

However, decision makers are often overwhelmed by the abundance of information, and the usage of text mining (TM) tools is still at its infancy. This study validates an extended technology acceptance model integrating information quality (IQ) and top management support. Results confirm that IQ influences behavioral intentions and TM tools usage, through perceptions of external control, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness; top management support also has a key role in determining the usage of TM tools.

However, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly changed firms' strategic decision-making landscapes and raised questions regarding the effects of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision-making as conditioned by COVID-19 characteristics. In this study, we contextualize two important event impact factors (i.e., event criticality and event disruption) in the context of COVID-19 and examine their contingent roles in the effects of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision-making. Our analyses, based on two-round, multi-respondents matched survey data collected from 175 Chinese firms to elucidate the differential moderating roles of event criticality and disruption of COVID-19 in the impact of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision speed and quality.

While there is some evidence that information technology (IT) capabilities can help organizations to be more agile, studies have reported mixed findings regarding such effects. In this study, we identify the conditions under which IT capabilities translate into agility gains. We focus on a specific and critical IT capability, the use of data analytics, which is often leveraged by firms to improve decision making and achieve agility gains. We leverage dynamic capability theory to understand the influence of data analytics use as a lower-order dynamic capability on firm agility as a higher-order dynamic capability. We also draw on the fit perspective to suggest that this impact will only accrue if there is a high degree of fit between several elements that are closely related t},

Abstract = {Big data analytics (BDA) are gaining importance in all aspects of business management. This is driven by both the presence of large-scale data and management's desire to root decisions in data. Extant research demonstrates that supply chain and operations management functions are among the biggest sources and users of data in the company. Therefore, their decision-making processes would benefit from increased use of BDA technologies. However, there is still a lack of understanding of what determines a company's ability to build BDA capability to gain a competitive advantage. In this study, we attempt to answer this fundamental question by identifying the factors that assist a company in or inhibit it from building its BDA capability and maximizing its gains through BDA technologies. We base our findings on a qualitative analysis of data collected from field visits, interviews with senior management, and secondary resources.

Consequently, identifying ways of effectively reducing the frequency and severity of traffic accidents is of utmost importance. In light of the depicted challenge, latest studies provide promising evidence that in-vehicle decision support systems (DSSs) can have significant positive effects on driving behaviour and collision avoidance. Going beyond existing research, we developed a comprehensive in-vehicle DSS, which provides accident hotspot warnings to drivers based on location analytics applied to a national historical accident dataset, composed of over 266,000 accidents. As such, we depict the design and field evaluation of an in-vehicle DSS, bridging the gap between real world location analytics and in-vehicle warnings.

Abstract = {Abstract: Personalized marketing via mobile devices, also known as Mobile Personalized Marketing (MPM), has become an increasingly important marketing tool because the ubiquity, interactivity and localization of mobile devices offers great potential for understanding customers' preferences and quickly advertising customized products or services. A tremendous challenge in MPM is to factor a mobile user's context into the prediction of the user's preferences. This paper proposes a novel framework with a three-stage procedure to discover the correlation between contexts of mobile users and their activities for better predicting customers' preferences. Our framework helps not only to discover sequential rules from contextual data, but also to overcome a common barrier in mining contextual data, i.e. elimination of redundant rules that occur when multiple dimensions of contextual information are used in the prediction.

Abstract = {Time-series data—measurements of a quantity over time—can be presented as stocks (the quantity at each point in time) or flows (the change in quantity from one point in time to the next). In a series of six experiments, we find that the choice of presenting data as stocks or flows can have a consequential impact on judgments. The same data can lead to positive or negative assessments when presented as stocks versus flows and can engender optimistic or pessimistic forecasts for the future. For example, when employment data from 2007 to 2013 are shown as flows (jobs created or lost), President Obama's impact on the economy during his first year in office is viewed positively, whereas when the same data are shown as stocks (total jobs), his impact is viewed negatively.

The authors employ a hierarchical modeling approach to test their hypotheses using a data set of in-store intercept interviews conducted with 2300 consumers across 28 stores. The results show that category characteristics, such as purchase frequency and displays, and customer characteristics, such as household size and gender, affect in-store decision making. Moreover, although the analysis reveals that the baseline probability of an unplanned purchase is 46{\%}, the contextual factors can drive this probability as high as 93{\%}. The results support the predictions that list use, more frequent trips, limiting the aisles visited, limiting time spent in the store, and paying by cash are effective strategies for decreasing the likelihood of making unplanned purchases.},

We then employ state-of-the-art machine learning approaches such as deep learning and text mining to operationalize these new content features in a scalable and systematic manner. For the newly developed features, we validate them against human coders on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Furthermore, we conduct two case studies with a large social media dataset from Tumblr to show the effectiveness of the proposed content features. The first case study demonstrates that both theoretically motivated and data-driven features significantly improve the model’s power to predi},

Abstract = {Code reuse is fundamental to the development of open-source software (OSS). Therefore, understanding how and why it occurs is important. To date, researchers have examined code reuse in OSS largely from the perspective of leaders. We show why followers must be considered as well. “Followers” are people who have had previous contacts with an individual from another project and who continue to associate with him or her. We consider two types of followers: developers (those directly involved in software development) and observers (those indirectly involved in it). We conduct a series of empirical investigations by using a longitudinal dataset of OSS projects hosted in GitHub, along with a survey and qualitative data. We find that followership can affect code reuse, but the effect depends on the nature of the follower (developer or observer). Overall, our study suggests that followership is important for code reuse in OSS because it enables participants to learn, and learning promotes cod},

Abstract = {As the mobile app market grows rapidly, with millions of apps and billions of users, search costs are increasing tremendously. Similar to the case of recommender systems, the challenge is how apps can be recommended to the right users and how consumers can find the right apps. This paper studies a new mobile app ad framework, cross-promotion (CP), which is to promote new "target" apps within other "source" apps. With unique random matching experiment data, we empirically test the important determinants of ad effectiveness. We then propose a machine-learning-based framework to optimally match source apps to target apps to improve ad effectiveness in terms of app downloads and postdownload usages. The simulation results show that app analytics capability is essential in building accurate prediction models and in increasing ad effectiveness of CP campaigns and that, at the expense of privacy, individual user data can further improve the matching performance. The paper has important manag},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a two-step data-analytic approach to the promotion planning for mobile applications (apps). In the first step, we use historical sales data to estimate the app demand model and quantify the effect of price promotions on download volume. The estimation results reveal two interesting characteristics of the relationship between price promotion and download volume of mobile apps: (1) the magnitude of the direct immediate promotion effect is declining within a multiday promotion; and (2) due to the visibility effect (i.e., apps ranked high on the download chart are more visible to consumers), a price promotion also has an indirect effect on download volume by affecting app rank, and this effect can persist after the promotion ends. Based on the empirically estimated demand model, we propose a moving planning window heuristic to construct a promotion policy. Our heuristic promotion policy consists of shorter and more frequent promotions. We show that the proposed p},

Abstract = {Phishing is a major threat to individuals and organizations. Along with billions of dollars lost annually, phishing attacks have led to significant data breaches, loss of corporate secrets, and espionage. Despite the significant threat, potential phishing targets have little theoretical or practical guidance on which phishing tactics are most dangerous and require heightened caution. The current study extends persuasion and motivation theory to postulate why certain influence techniques are especially dangerous when used in phishing attacks. We evaluated our hypotheses using a large field experiment that involved sending phishing messages to more than 2,600 participants. Results indicated a disparity in levels of danger presented by different influence techniques used in phishing attacks. Specifically, participants were less vulnerable to phishing influence techniques that relied on fictitious prior shared experience and were more vulnerable to techniques offering a high level of self},

Results showed that both trainees and peers demonstrated improved healthcare data analytics skills over time, related to concomitant increases in their healthcare data analytics-related learning and performance goals.

@article{MarchenaSekli.2021,
 abstract = {Due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, higher education institutions are challenged to continue providing quality teaching, consulting, and research production through virtual education environments. In this context, a large volume of data is being generated, and technologies such as big data analytics are needed to create opportunities for open innovation by obtaining valuable knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of big data analytics and evaluate the relationship it has with performance and knowledge management, taking into consideration that this technology is in its initial stages and that previous research has provided varied results depending on the sector in focus. To address these challenges, a theoretical framework is developed to empirically test the relationship of these variables; 265 members of universities in Latin America were surveyed, and structural equation modeling is used. The findings identify compatibility, an adequate organizational data environment, and external support as factors required to adopt big data analytics, and their positive relationship is tested with knowledge management processes and organizational performance. This study provides practical guidance for decision-makers involved in or in charge of defining the implementation strategy of big data analytics in higher education institutions.},
