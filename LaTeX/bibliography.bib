Abstract = {The number of mobile apps launched in the market has exponentially grown to more than 2 million, but little is known about how users choose and consume apps of numerous categories. This study develops a utility theory-based structural model for mobile app analytics. We use the theoretical concepts of utility and satiation along with the factor analytic approach, as bases in simultaneously modeling the complex relationships among choice, consumption, and utility maximization for consumers of various mobile apps. Using a unique panel dataset detailing individual user-level mobile app time consumption, we quantify the baseline utility and satiation levels of diverse mobile apps and delineate how app preferences and consumption patterns vary across demographic groups affected by persistent use and time trends. The findings suggest that users’ baseline utility substantially diverges across app categories and that their demographic characteristics and habit formation explain the appreciable},

Abstract = {In the past few years, big data has attracted significant attention, and many analytics platforms, such as Hadoop, have been developed to enable the analysis of massive data. Nevertheless, it is still very challenging to provision, let alone optimize, a comprehensive system that includes various aspects, from the computing infrastructure to the analytics programs. To tackle this challenge, in this article, we propose a novel provisioning framework, BigProvision, to provision big data analytics systems. The main idea of the framework is to first evaluate and model the performance of different big data analytics approaches, given a set of sample data and various analytics requirements, such as the expected results, budget, response time, and so on. Based on the evaluation and modeling results, BigProvision can generate a provisioning configuration that can be used to configure the whole system for big data analytics. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we develop an e},

Abstract = {In the current data-driven digital economy, organizations attempt to harness big data power to make their decisions better. The big data analytics assist them not only to identify new opportunities but extract knowledge and obtain better performance. Despite a huge investment in big data analytics initiatives, the majority of organizations have failed to successfully exploit their power. Although big data analytics have received considerable research attention, a little has been done on how organizations implement strategies in order to integrate the different dimensions of big data analytics; hence, a roadmap is required to navigate these technological initiatives. This paper is also an attempt to overcome this challenge by developing a comprehensive big data analytics maturity model to help managers evaluate their existing capabilities and formulate an appropriate strategy for further progress. A mixed-method was applied in this research using a qualitative meta-synthesis approach. },

Abstract = {Addressing consistent and reliable decision-making are crucial activities when choosing seemingly related alternatives for a set of criteria. Models and methods for aiding decisions such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were developed to handle quantified assessments of quality attributes, usually intangible and numerically hard to cope. We introduce the Decisor software tool to assist the use of AHP to drive complex decision modeling. We present a study of related tools describing advantages and drawbacks. The tool is user friendly, with intuitive data entry fields. Users may input alternatives and criteria, assigning weights from different judgment scales. Decisor's main characteristic is its simple interface where the tool computes priority vectors for all alternatives and its consistency rates. It is also possible to operate with negative weighting, inferring Benefits, Opportunities, Costs, and Risks. The tool implements Group Decisions, using the geometric mean to combine crit},

Abstract = {Data analytics has become an increasingly eye-catching practice in both the academic and the business communities. The importance of data analytics has also prompted growing literature to focus on the design of data analytics. However, the boundary conditions for data analytics in creating value have been largely overlooked in the literature. The objective of this article therefore is to examine the business value of data analytics usage and explore how such value differs in different market conditions. We rely on an online B2C platform as our empirical setting and obtain several important insights. First, both demand-side and supply-side data analytics usage has a positive effect on the performance of merchants. Second, when merchants’ product variety is high, the influence of usage toward demand-side data on performance is strengthened, whereas such impact is weakened for supply-side data analytics. Third, when competitive intensity is high, the performance implication of demand-sid},

However, decision makers are often overwhelmed by the abundance of information, and the usage of text mining (TM) tools is still at its infancy. This study validates an extended technology acceptance model integrating information quality (IQ) and top management support. Results confirm that IQ influences behavioral intentions and TM tools usage, through perceptions of external control, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness; top management support also has a key role in determining the usage of TM tools.

However, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly changed firms' strategic decision-making landscapes and raised questions regarding the effects of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision-making as conditioned by COVID-19 characteristics. In this study, we contextualize two important event impact factors (i.e., event criticality and event disruption) in the context of COVID-19 and examine their contingent roles in the effects of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision-making. Our analyses, based on two-round, multi-respondents matched survey data collected from 175 Chinese firms to elucidate the differential moderating roles of event criticality and disruption of COVID-19 in the impact of ITBA and BDAC on strategic decision speed and quality.

Abstract = {Agility, which refers to a dynamic capability within firms to identify and effectively respond to threats and opportunities with speed, is considered as a main business imperative in modern business environments. While there is some evidence that information technology (IT) capabilities can help organizations to be more agile, studies have reported mixed findings regarding such effects. In this study, we identify the conditions under which IT capabilities translate into agility gains. We focus on a specific and critical IT capability, the use of data analytics, which is often leveraged by firms to improve decision making and achieve agility gains. We leverage dynamic capability theory to understand the influence of data analytics use as a lower-order dynamic capability on firm agility as a higher-order dynamic capability. We also draw on the fit perspective to suggest that this impact will only accrue if there is a high degree of fit between several elements that are closely related t},

Abstract = {Big data analytics (BDA) are gaining importance in all aspects of business management. This is driven by both the presence of large-scale data and management's desire to root decisions in data. Extant research demonstrates that supply chain and operations management functions are among the biggest sources and users of data in the company. Therefore, their decision-making processes would benefit from increased use of BDA technologies. However, there is still a lack of understanding of what determines a company's ability to build BDA capability to gain a competitive advantage. In this study, we attempt to answer this fundamental question by identifying the factors that assist a company in or inhibit it from building its BDA capability and maximizing its gains through BDA technologies. We base our findings on a qualitative analysis of data collected from field visits, interviews with senior management, and secondary resources.

Consequently, identifying ways of effectively reducing the frequency and severity of traffic accidents is of utmost importance. In light of the depicted challenge, latest studies provide promising evidence that in-vehicle decision support systems (DSSs) can have significant positive effects on driving behaviour and collision avoidance. Going beyond existing research, we developed a comprehensive in-vehicle DSS, which provides accident hotspot warnings to drivers based on location analytics applied to a national historical accident dataset, composed of over 266,000 accidents. As such, we depict the design and field evaluation of an in-vehicle DSS, bridging the gap between real world location analytics and in-vehicle warnings.

Abstract = {Abstract: Personalized marketing via mobile devices, also known as Mobile Personalized Marketing (MPM), has become an increasingly important marketing tool because the ubiquity, interactivity and localization of mobile devices offers great potential for understanding customers' preferences and quickly advertising customized products or services. A tremendous challenge in MPM is to factor a mobile user's context into the prediction of the user's preferences. This paper proposes a novel framework with a three-stage procedure to discover the correlation between contexts of mobile users and their activities for better predicting customers' preferences. Our framework helps not only to discover sequential rules from contextual data, but also to overcome a common barrier in mining contextual data, i.e. elimination of redundant rules that occur when multiple dimensions of contextual information are used in the prediction.

Abstract = {Time-series data—measurements of a quantity over time—can be presented as stocks (the quantity at each point in time) or flows (the change in quantity from one point in time to the next). In a series of six experiments, we find that the choice of presenting data as stocks or flows can have a consequential impact on judgments. The same data can lead to positive or negative assessments when presented as stocks versus flows and can engender optimistic or pessimistic forecasts for the future. For example, when employment data from 2007 to 2013 are shown as flows (jobs created or lost), President Obama's impact on the economy during his first year in office is viewed positively, whereas when the same data are shown as stocks (total jobs), his impact is viewed negatively.

The authors employ a hierarchical modeling approach to test their hypotheses using a data set of in-store intercept interviews conducted with 2300 consumers across 28 stores. The results show that category characteristics, such as purchase frequency and displays, and customer characteristics, such as household size and gender, affect in-store decision making. Moreover, although the analysis reveals that the baseline probability of an unplanned purchase is 46{\%}, the contextual factors can drive this probability as high as 93{\%}. The results support the predictions that list use, more frequent trips, limiting the aisles visited, limiting time spent in the store, and paying by cash are effective strategies for decreasing the likelihood of making unplanned purchases.},

Abstract = {Code reuse is fundamental to the development of open-source software (OSS). Therefore, understanding how and why it occurs is important. To date, researchers have examined code reuse in OSS largely from the perspective of leaders. We show why followers must be considered as well. “Followers” are people who have had previous contacts with an individual from another project and who continue to associate with him or her. We consider two types of followers: developers (those directly involved in software development) and observers (those indirectly involved in it). We conduct a series of empirical investigations by using a longitudinal dataset of OSS projects hosted in GitHub, along with a survey and qualitative data. We find that followership can affect code reuse, but the effect depends on the nature of the follower (developer or observer). Overall, our study suggests that followership is important for code reuse in OSS because it enables participants to learn, and learning promotes cod},

Abstract = {As the mobile app market grows rapidly, with millions of apps and billions of users, search costs are increasing tremendously. Similar to the case of recommender systems, the challenge is how apps can be recommended to the right users and how consumers can find the right apps. This paper studies a new mobile app ad framework, cross-promotion (CP), which is to promote new "target" apps within other "source" apps. With unique random matching experiment data, we empirically test the important determinants of ad effectiveness. We then propose a machine-learning-based framework to optimally match source apps to target apps to improve ad effectiveness in terms of app downloads and postdownload usages. The simulation results show that app analytics capability is essential in building accurate prediction models and in increasing ad effectiveness of CP campaigns and that, at the expense of privacy, individual user data can further improve the matching performance.

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a two-step data-analytic approach to the promotion planning for mobile applications (apps). In the first step, we use historical sales data to estimate the app demand model and quantify the effect of price promotions on download volume. The estimation results reveal two interesting characteristics of the relationship between price promotion and download volume of mobile apps: (1) the magnitude of the direct immediate promotion effect is declining within a multiday promotion; and (2) due to the visibility effect (i.e., apps ranked high on the download chart are more visible to consumers), a price promotion also has an indirect effect on download volume by affecting app rank, and this effect can persist after the promotion ends. Based on the empirically estimated demand model, we propose a moving planning window heuristic to construct a promotion policy. Our heuristic promotion policy consists of shorter and more frequent promotions. We show that the proposed p},

In this conceptual study, we propose a definition of CC as it applies to international business and develop a model for understanding how CC is nurtured in individuals, linking our definition to the concept of cultural intelligence. We discuss the components of the model and suggest that there are environmental and contextual impediments to the effective application of the requisite skills, knowledge and attributes that have been identified as necessary for CC, resulting in a gap between 'knowing' and 'doing'.

Our analysis shows that AI adoption triggers interrelated substitution and complementation dynamics, which make humans' traditional competitive capabilities obsolete, while creating new sources of persistent heterogeneity when humans interact with chess engines. These novel human‐machine capabilities are unrelated, or even negatively related, to traditional capabilities. We contribute an integrated view of substitution and complementation, which identifies AI as the driver of these dynamics and explains how they jointly shift the sources of competitive advantage.

Survey data collected from top and middle-level managers from 133 U.S.-based firms indicates that: the impact of data analytics use on the quality of firm decisions is fully mediated by knowledge sharing; the impact of knowledge sharing on firm decision quality is not significant and it is moderated by data analytics competency; and data analytics competency does not moderate the impact of data analytics use on knowledge sharing.

 abstract = {Firms are increasingly opening up their innovation efforts to allow users to tap into the benefits they can offer, such as mobile data service (MDS) innovation on iOS and Google Android platforms. For this purpose, platforms typically provide toolkits to facilitate user participation, aiming to create an ecosystem for sustainable innovation. However, with the barriers to user innovation and attrition of existing innovators, it could be challenging for firms to attract and sustain users’ MDS innovation. With the possible benefits from user innovation, and considering the challenges faced, firms need to understand how to influence potential user innovators to take part and to encourage extant user innovators to innovate again. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research and understanding of what drives users’ intentions to innovate services and the differences in the antecedents of such intention between potential and actual user innovators. Further, although prior studies have suggested that toolkits can support user innovation, little research has theorized and empirically tested their influence. Motivated thus, this study proposes a model based on (1) user innovation theory to explain the antecedents (including toolkit support) of user MDS innovation intention and (2) construal level theory to explain the differential effects of the antecedents for actual and potential user innovators. We tested the model through survey data from potential and actual MDS user innovators on Google Android and iOS platforms. We find that trend leadership and anticipated extrinsic reward influence both potential and actual user innovators’ intentions to innovate. However, anticipated recognition and toolkit support affect only actual user innovators, while anticipated enjoyment affects only potential user innovators. Interestingly, toolkit support strengthens the influence of anticipated enjoyment for actual user innovators but weakens its influence for potential user innovators. Further, potential user innovators value anticipated extrinsic rewards less than actual innovators do. The implications for research and practice are discussed.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experiment designed to investigate the impact of computer-based graphics on decision making. The experimental task consisted of selecting quarterly reorder quantities for an importer under condition of uncertain demand. Subjects in the experiment were participants in an executive program for middle and upper level managers. Each subject received information on the cumulative probability distribution of demand and had an opportunity to run up to eight trial simulations with past demand data using his or her order quantities. After completing the trial simulations, the subjects made quarterly ordering decisions for one year in which the quantities demanded were drawn from the demand distribution. Treatments included the use of a hard copy terminal and five different types of displays on a CRT. The results of the experiment provide limited support for the use of graphics presentation in an information system. Decision or cognitive style also appears to be an important variable influencing the performance of an individual and the reaction to an information system. The implications of the findings for the design of information systems are discussed.},

In particular, the strategic decision to commit to full-scale development of a new product is considered. At the core of the framework are the methods and techniques used for acquiring, modeling and processing the expert knowledge and data. Methods and techniques used include scoring models, logic tables, the analytic hierarchy process, discriminant analysis, and rule-based systems. The suggested modeling approach obtains the benefits of normative modeling as well as the flexibility and developmental advantages of expert systems. Additional benefits include reduced information processing and gathering time, which can help to accelerate the product development cycle. Potential spin-offs of this research include applications for project evaluation throughout the product development cycle and other areas such as capital budgeting. Finally, a series of related case studies that have successfully implemented this framework is described.},

Past research claiming usefulness of the DSS has relied largely on anecdotal or case data. The relatively few laboratory experiments report mixed results regarding the effects of a decision aid. This study reviews the results of prior investigations and examines the effectiveness of DSS-aided decision makers relative to decision makers without a DSS over an eight-week period. An executive decision making game was used in two sections of a business strategy course. Three-person teams in one section used a DSS while the teams in the other section played the game without such an aid. Various measures of decision quality were recorded. Overall, the groups with access to the DSS made significantly more effective decisions in the business simulation game than their non-DSS counterparts. The DSS groups took more time to make their decisions than the non-DSS groups at the beginning of the experiment. However, the decision times converged after the third week. The DSS teams reported investigating more alternatives and exhibited a higher confidence level in their decisions than the non-DSS groups, but these differences were not statistically significant.},

We observe that the type of decision-making process hinges on the nature of managers' emerging awareness of future events. When managers become aware of new uncertainty, the process involves selectiveness, deliberateness, and diligence. By contrast, when managers become aware of new certainty, the process conforms to the problem-solving adhocracy and decision-making messiness emphasized in prior literature. We summarize our findings in a framework, proposing that decision-level differences in awareness and uncertainty can explain the observed variation in strategic decision-making processes during implementation. We also discuss implications for theory on procedural rationality and analytical comprehensiveness.},

abstract={Clickstream data provide information about the sequence of pages or the path viewed by users as they navigate a website. We show how path information can be categorized and modeled using a dynamic multinomial probit model of Web browsing. We estimate this model using data from a major online bookseller. Our results show that the memory component of the model is crucial in accurately predicting a path. In comparison, traditional multinomial probit and first-order Markov models predict paths poorly. These results suggest that paths may reflect a user's goals, which could be helpful in predicting future movements at a website. One potential application of our model is to predict purchase conversion. We find that after only six viewings purchasers can be predicted with more than 40{\%} accuracy, which is much better than the benchmark 7{\%} purchase conversion prediction rate made without path information. This technique could be used to personalize Web designs and product offerings based upon a user's path. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT},

However, their generated data is worthless without information retrieval through data analytics. As Big Data is too big for a single person to investigate, appropriate technologies are being used. Unfortunately, there is not one solution but a large variety of different tools, each of them with other functionalities, properties and characteristics. Especially small and midsized companies have a hard time to keep track as this requires time, skills, money, and specific knowledge which result in high entrance barriers for Big Data utilization. This papers aims to reduce these barriers by explaining and structuring different classes of technologies and basic criteria for proper technology selection. It proposes a framework that guides especially small and mid-sized companies through a suitable selection process that can serve as a basis for further advances.},

As such, it serves as an initial ontology for business analytics as a field of study. The foundation has three main parts dealing with the whence and whither of business analytics: identification of dimensions along which business analytics possibilities can be examined, derivation of a six-class taxonomy that covers business analytics perspectives in the literature, and design of an inclusive framework for the field of business analytics. In addition to unifying the literature, a major contribution of the designed framework is that it can stimulate thinking about the nature, roles, and future of business analytics initiatives.

Following prior work on using chess as a controlled setting for studying competitive interactions, we compare the same players' capabilities and performance across conventional, centaur, and engine chess tournaments. Our analysis shows that AI adoption triggers interrelated substitution and complementation dynamics, which make humans' traditional competitive capabilities obsolete, while creating new sources of persistent heterogeneity when humans interact with chess engines. These novel human‐machine capabilities are unrelated, or even negatively related, to traditional capabilities. We contribute an integrated view of substitution and complementation, which identifies AI as the driver of these dynamics and explains how they jointly shift the sources of competitive advantage.

%abstract = {Grundlagen der App-Programmierung für Android mit Java und XML Mit einem durchgehenden Beispiel Schritt für Schritt Apps programmieren lernen Für alle aktuellen Android-Versionen Eugen Richter vermittelt Ihnen in diesem Buch anschaulich die Grundlagen der Android-Programmierung mit Java und XML. Java-Vorkenntnisse sind dabei nicht zwingend erforderlich – um optimal mit dem Buch arbeiten zu können, reicht ein grundlegendes Verständnis für objektorientierte Programmierung aus. Sie lernen die Grundbausteine einer Android-App kennen und wie Sie Android Studio als Entwicklungsumgebung optimal nutzen. In weiteren praxisnahen Kapiteln erhalten Sie dann ein tieferes Verständnis für das Programmieren von Android-Apps in Form eines Workshops: Am Beispiel einer einfachen App lernen Sie die wichtigsten Komponenten kennen, die in den meisten modernen Apps zum Einsatz kommen – von einer einfachen Activity über Listen und Datenbanken bis hin zum Internet-Zugriff und automatisierten Tests. So werden alle Techniken und Technologien am praktischen Einsatz erklärt. Sie können direkt loslegen und alle Arbeitsschritte von der Projektanlage bis zum Testen des fertigen Codes an der im Buch programmierten App nachvollziehen. Alle Beispieldateien sowie weitere Informationen zu den im Buch angesprochenen Themen finden Sie online auf einer eigens eingerichteten Bitbucket-Projektseite. Aus dem Inhalt: Grundlagen Android Studio Gradle als Build-System Projektanlage Layout und Navigation erstellen Einbinden einer SQLite-Datenbank Implementieren eines Content Providers Export von Daten Dialoge Verarbeitung im Hintergrund Berechtigungen Trennung von Layout, Layout-Logik und Businesslogik Internet-Zugriff Unit-Testing Veröffentlichen der fertigen App Glossar Über den Autor: Eugen Richter hat langjährige Schulungserfahrung u.a. als Dozent an der Münchener Volkshochschule und als Ausbilder im Unternehmen. Sein thematischer Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf der mobilen Entwicklung von Apps für Android sowie der Cross-Plattform-Entwicklung.},

 abstract = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test controlled study was conducted in a large medical system in the eastern United States. Healthcare data analytics training program participants (N = 21) and a comparison group comprising trainee-identified peers completing comparable work (N = 27) were compared at the start of training and one year later. Results showed that both trainees and peers demonstrated improved healthcare data analytics skills over time, related to concomitant increases in their healthcare data analytics-related learning and performance goals. This study suggests that healthcare organizations aiming at successfully implementing a new data analytics infrastructure should provide well-designed training that enables trainees to develop specific learning and performance goals as well as improve relevant skills and ability to use new tools.},

@article{MarchenaSekli.2021,
 abstract = {Due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, higher education institutions are challenged to continue providing quality teaching, consulting, and research production through virtual education environments. In this context, a large volume of data is being generated, and technologies such as big data analytics are needed to create opportunities for open innovation by obtaining valuable knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of big data analytics and evaluate the relationship it has with performance and knowledge management, taking into consideration that this technology is in its initial stages and that previous research has provided varied results depending on the sector in focus. To address these challenges, a theoretical framework is developed to empirically test the relationship of these variables; 265 members of universities in Latin America were surveyed, and structural equation modeling is used. The findings identify compatibility, an adequate organizational data environment, and external support as factors required to adopt big data analytics, and their positive relationship is tested with knowledge management processes and organizational performance. This study provides practical guidance for decision-makers involved in or in charge of defining the implementation strategy of big data analytics in higher education institutions.},
