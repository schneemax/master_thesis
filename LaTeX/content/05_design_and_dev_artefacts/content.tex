\newpage\section{Design and Development of the Artefacts}

The artifact, which is intended to improve experimental research in behavioral data analytics, is to be implemented as a software component or application. In this step, a suitable architecture is developed based on the established requirements. For this purpose, the basic technical framework and system architecture are presented first. Subsequently, the artifact is concretely conceptualized by elaborating different process steps of the application. Then, customizing and output capabilities of the final application are conceptualized and finally the user interface and specific components of the application.

\subsection{Technological Framework and System Architecture}

This section is intended to provide an overview of the technological framework used and the basic architecture of the application. This section focuses primarily on a basic overview, while the next sections go into more detail about the individual components.

\subsubsection{Java}

Java is a programming language originally developed by Microsystems. Since 2009 Java is part of the product portfolio of Oracle Corporation. Java is an object-oriented programming language, which makes it an universally applicable and robust programming language.
