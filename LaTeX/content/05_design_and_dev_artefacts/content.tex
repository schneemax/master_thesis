\newpage\section{Design and Development of the Artefacts}

The artifact, which is intended to improve experimental research in behavioral data analytics, is to be implemented as a software component or application. In this step, a suitable architecture is developed based on the established requirements. For this purpose, the basic technical framework and system architecture are presented first. Subsequently, the artifact is concretely conceptualized by elaborating different process steps of the application. Then, customizing and output capabilities of the final application are conceptualized and finally the user interface and specific components of the application.

\subsection{Technological Framework and System Architecture}

This section is intended to provide an overview of the technological framework used and the basic architecture of the application. This section focuses primarily on a basic overview, while the next sections go into more detail about the individual components.

\subsubsection{Java}

Java is a programming language originally developed by Microsystems. Since 2009 Java is part of the product portfolio of Oracle Corporation. Java is an object-oriented programming language, which makes it an universally applicable and robust programming language (\cite{Ullenboom.2017}).

Unlike many other programming languages, one of the special features of Java is its platform independence. Most programming languages use a compiler or interpreter to translate program code into byte code, which varies depending on the hardware and can only be executed on the appropriate processors. Java avoids this limitation by first having a compiler translate the Java program code into byte code, which is then executed in a virtual environment, the \ac{jvm}, with the help of an interpreter. In this way, Java code can theoretically be executed on any system (\cite{Ullenboom.2017}).

Java is not only a programming language, but also a runtime system, which Oracle wants to make clear with the term Java Platform. Thus, in addition to the Java programming language, there are certainly other languages that run a Java runtime environment, such as various scripting languages like Groovy (http://groovy-lang.org), JRuby (http://jruby.org), Jython (http://www.jython.org), Kotlin (http://kotlinlang.org) or Scala (http://www.scala-lang.org). Scripting languages on the Java platform are becoming more popular; they establish a different syntax but use the \ac{jvm} and libraries (\cite{Ullenboom.2017}).

Along with the programming language and \ac{jvm} comes a set of standard libraries for data structures, string processing, date/time processing, graphical interfaces, input/output, network operations, and more. This forms the basis for higher-level services such as database connections or web services. An integral part of the standard library since Java 1.0 are still threads. They are easy-to-create execution threads that can work independently of each other. In the meantime all popular operating systems support these \enquote{lightweight processes} by house, so that the \ac{jvm} does not have to reproduce these parallel program parts, but can refer to the operating system. On the new multi-core processors, the operating system ensures optimum utilization of the computing power, since threads can really work concurrently (\cite{Ullenboom.2017}).

\subsection{Technological Conceptualization}

\subsubsection{Process Mechanisms}

In order to effectively implement the requirements for the application, the processes described by the requirements and validated by the test cases are represented in the following by swim lane diagrams. The goal of this is to illustrate the individual processes in a technology-independent manner. The reason for this is that the individual processes are initially presented in generalized form, irrespective of technological restrictions or limitations. The following Swim Lane diagrams represent the individual steps of the experiment. A large part of the final functionalities can be divided into two different categories. An example of this are the requirements (F2, F3 and N5.1), whereby the application should offer both the possibility to read in and save user data and to make the experiment setup reusable. These requirements can be summarized in functions and data concerning the experiment and functions and data concerning the participants. The two lanes \enquote{Participant file} and \enquote{Experiment file} are representative for those two categories and data sources. The \enquote{User} lane shows the activities performed by the test subjects, the \enquote{Experimental file} lane shows all activities that can be associated with the experimental set-up, and the \enquote{Patricipant} file lane shows all activities that are related to the data or distribution of the test subjects.

    \caption{Experiment - Swim lane}    
    \label{fig:experimentSwimLane}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:experimentSwimLane} shows the basic structure of an experiment with the conceptualized application. The whole experiment is divided into different experiment steps, which are executed one after the other until the experiment is completed. The application is started first and then the first step of the experiment is executed. This could be for example an information message for the participants. After that the next step is executed if another step is available. If no further step is available, the experiment ends. This simple abstraction of an experiment concentrates on the essentials and thus allows the most flexible and adaptable construction kit for an experiment. The individual steps of the experiment, which are executed one after the other, can be customized by the person performing the experiment as well as mapped by standard steps. The standard steps represent steps which have to be used in a multitude of experiments and thus partially represent requirements. In the following, some of these experiment steps which illustrate standard steps that are included in the application are illustrated with the help of swim lane diagrams. Figure \ref{fig:DataInputSwimLane}, \ref{fig:groupAllocationSwimLane}, \ref{fig:questionairSwimLane} and \ref{fig:infoScreenSwimLane} represent these standard steps. The dashed box \enquote{Experimental Step} of figur \ref{fig:experimentSwimLane} can be replaced by any number of these. For this reason, the graphics mentioned also begin and end in the \enquote{Experimental file} lane.

    \caption{Data input step - Swim lane}    
    \label{fig:DataInputSwimLane}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:DataInputSwimLane} represents the process step of reading data from one or more sources. The assumption is that this data must first be processed or standardized before it can be meaningfully assigned to the participants.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{content/05_design_and_dev_artefacts/ChooseTestSubjectSwimLane.drawio.pdf}
    \caption{Choose test subject step - Swim lane}    
    \label{fig:ChooseTestSubjectSwimLane}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ChooseTestSubjectSwimLane} enables the mapping between the test subject and their ID which will be used for the rest of the experiment.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{content/05_design_and_dev_artefacts/GroupAllocationSwimLane.drawio.pdf}
    \caption{Group allocation step - Swim lane}    
    \label{fig:groupAllocationSwimLane}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:groupAllocationSwimLane} represents the process of assigning individual participants into groups. This can either be the case that participants are divided according to a predefined group, arbitrarily or according to certain criteria.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{content/05_design_and_dev_artefacts/QuestionairSwimLane.drawio.pdf}
    \caption{Questionair step - Swim lane}    
    \label{fig:questionairSwimLane}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:questionairSwimLane} is used to complete the data of the participants. For this purpose, test subject questions are asked based on missing data which are to be answered by the participant. An example would be a test subject for which the age is missing. An input field is automatically displayed for the participant to fill in the missing data. If all data for a test subject is available, nothing is displayed.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{content/05_design_and_dev_artefacts/InfoScreenSwimLane.drawio.pdf}
    \caption{Info screen step - Swim lane}    
    \label{fig:infoScreenSwimLane}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:infoScreenSwimLane} displays information to the Test Subjects and can be used both as a means of notification during an experiment and as a representation of information.
