\subsection{Background and Motivation}

%Einführung Data Analytics ist wichtig
The introduction and widespread usage of computers has proven to be disruptive for all industries. Entire industrial sectors have been reshaped, whole professions made obsolete and new career opportunities have been created. This shift towards the adaption of \ac{it} has been necessary for businesses to stay competitive in the fast changing economic environment of the twenty-first century. Nowadays, the digitalization of organizations is viewed as a prerequisite for a successful business, rather than being an endeavored state and computers are indispensable for all industries. This digital revolution enabled the emergence of the widespread creation and collection of data. The amount of data generated globally is rising yearly (\cite{Seagate.2018}) and the pressure to use these data volumes effectively in order to gain a business advantage rises. 
This new trend, often coined \enquote{big data} after the fact that never before seen amounts of data are generated and are available for processing, enables completely new business areas. This is reinforced, among other things, by the fact that many companies already view their data as a primary business asset (\cite{Redman.2008}). Simultaneously, the emergence of big data promises to completely reshape the decision-making process of traditional businesses through the adoption of data analytics. Although sales in the area of big data have risen significantly over the past years (\cite{BISResearch.2018}, \cite{Bitkom.2018}) and businesses already view big data as an important information technology trend (\cite{Bitkom.2017}) a lot of organizations struggle to effectivly utilize their data. 

%Es wurde teilweise wenig geforscht, speziell wenig zu behavioral Aspekten
In their article, Amankwah-Amoah and Adomako study the influence of big data usage on business failure. 
They come to the conclusion that the mere possession of big data as an asset has no positive effects on an organization. In order to prevent business failure, big data must be used effectively  (\cite{AmankwahAmoah.2019}). This, however, might be hindered by boundaries and conflicts that have arisen during an organization's existence. Technical challenges are only some part of the underlying problem. Boundaries that have surfaced due to behavioral aspects regarding these new technologies might also impact the effective usage of data analytics. This problem only becomes more apparent when new technologies which overlap with data analytics like machine learning and artificial intelligence are taken into account. These technologies, often concidered to be the next big thing which has its origins in said increase data collection, are already gaining a lot of the attention in both research and businesses. Although these "black box" technologies are even less explainable than more traditional big data and data analytics technologies, the focus on research clearly relies on technical apsects instead of behavioral boundaires and conflicts that might hinder the effectiveness of these technologies. Should corporate executives blindly rely on data analytics and machine learning for their decision making process or just use them as a support tool? If a senior manager has a different opinion on a product release than what is specified by data analytics processes, who's opinion should be prioritized and to what extend? The technical basis for these technologies has in many cases been laid, but the question of how to behave in relation to these new technologies is yet to be answered most of the time %by researchers. %has not been resolved.

%Der Prozess der Forschung selbst kann sehr aufwendig und umständlich sein
A lack of research in these areas can not only be attributed to these technologies being new. Answering these questions and conducting extensive research in this field can be expensive and time-consuming.

While some areas of research can be easily conducted and are only limited by funding or the number of researchers, the area of data analytics

%In this context, dealing with these new technologies in a broader sense is just as big a challenge as technical aspects.

%Many companies are at a point where they have a solid technical infrastructure and tools to deploy data analytics, but the decision-making process, use and day-to-day deployment of data analytics and how this technology should be handled in a wider sense is little questioned. This circumstance is further exacerbated by new trends which overlap with data analytics like machine learning and artificial intelligence. These technologies, often coined as the next big thing, are already gaining a lot of the attention in both research and businesses. Although these "black box" technologies are even less explainable than more traditional big data and data analytics technologies, much of the research regarding hindering boundaries and conflicts again focusses on the technology itself, rather than questioning the extent to which it should be used in the first place. Industries and researches are so focused on what these technologies can achieve that the question of whether it makes sense to use them at all, or to what extent, is not a priority. Should corporate executives blindly rely on data analytics and machine learning for their decision making process or just use them as a support tool? If a senior manager has a different opinion on a product release than what is specified by data analytics processes, who's opinion should be prioritized and to what extend? The technical basis for these technologies has been laid, but the question of how to behave in relation to these technologies has not been resolved.



%The reasons for these boundaries and conflicts that hinder the utilization of data analytics in organizations are not only limited to technical aspects, which concern the collection, processing and standardization of data, but also the handling of these new technologies in an overarching non-technical sense.
%While businesses already view big data as an important technology trend (\cite{Bitkom.2017}), there has been relatively little research done in the area of behavioral research. In the past couple of years this led many companies and researchers into spending an above-average share of resources into technical areas like data extraction, data preparation or data harmonization instead of researching the wider impact of data anyltics. While this has laid a solid foundation for the technology of data analytics itself, both in businesses and in research, it has also led to topics relating to the use and behavior of said technologies to being neglected.

%\subsection{Research Problem and Objectives}

\subsection{Objective and methodology of the work}

Behavioral research can be conducted using a variety of quantitative and qualitative means. The experiment is probably the most time-consuming type of qualitative research, since it requires a great deal of time for the researcher to conduct and perform and a huge time commitment on the side of the participant. One of the major challenges in conducting expertiments in the area of data analytics is the high cost of developing custom applications. The development of such applications can be time-consuming, expensive, and often requires specialized expertise. Although there are already different applications for conducting studies of various kinds, such as survey tools, there is still a lack of applications that have been specifically developed to conduct behavioral research in the field of data analytics. Particularly there is a lack of applications that enable researchers to create studies on a wide range of use cases, without the need to develop tailor-made applications for each specific studies. %that are not tailor-mode for a specific study, but represent a more generic framework like approach that can be utilized in a variety of different studies.
Moreover, follow-up research is made more difficult to conduct, as these custom applications are usually not publicly available and in most cases unflexible to customize for further studies. %Even if they are, it is to expected that these applications are very unflexible and would require a lot of investment to customize for slightly different use cases.
%Specifically, if a new application has to be created for each new study or follow up research, as these custom applications are usually not included in the publication of papers. 
This thesis objective is to support the process of behavioral research in the field of data analytics. Due to the aforementioned reasons, an artefact is developed which can be used to conduct experiments in the field of data analytics with the focus of behavioral research. This artefact is supposed to streamline and cheapen research. In order to accomplishe this, the \ac{dsc} Methodology is used which contains the six steps of \textit{Identification of the Problem}, \textit{Definition of Objectives for a solution}, \textit{Design and Dev of artefacts}, \textit{Demonstration of the Artifact}, \textit{Evaluation of the solution}, \textit{Communication}. The identification of the problem is conducted through a literature search with the goal of identifying the degree of research done in the area of data analyitics. To be more specific the current state of research in the field of boundaries and conflicts is investigates. In order to accomplish this, the identified literature is categorized using the so called information-value-chain. This is done in order to show the current state of research on the processing of data and to identify possible literature gaps. After identifying the problem, the next step of the \ac{dsc} Methodology \textit{Definition of Objectives for a solution} utilizes a second literature search to collect an detailed overview about what kind of studies have been conducted in the field of data analytics, with a special focus on, whether these studies have used custom applications to conduct experiments. These findings are then used to develop requirements using the requirement engineering framework, which is in of itself made up of four different steps \textit{Elicit requirements}, \textit{Requirements specification}, \textit{Verification and validation} and \textit{Requirements management}. These requirements are then used in the \textit{Design and Dev of artefacts steps} of the \ac{dsc} framework to develope a technical artefact as a solution for the afformentioned problem. Subsequently, the resulting artefact is demonstrated and Evaluation using the afformentioned requirements, in the \textit{Demonstration of the Artifact} and \textit{Evaluation of the solution} steps. The last step of the \ac{dsc} framework, which focusses on communicating the results to its stakeholders, is ensured by this thesis itself. The last step is thus already fulfilled by this theis itself and will not be considered further.

In summary the objective of this thesis is to develop a solution in the form of an artefact which enables researchers to design, conduct, and analyze studies more efficiently and cost-effectively, allowing them to explore the field of behavioral research in data analyitics in greater depth.
%The communication of the results is ensured by this work itself.%, which is why no furhter measures are taken to communicate
    



%To address this challenge, this thesis sets out to develop a generic application that streamlines the process of conducting studies in the field of data analytics.


%\subsection{Contribution and Scope of the Study}

%This application enables researchers to design, conduct, and analyze studies more efficiently and cost-effectively, allowing them to explore the field in greater depth. This will be accomplished by using the \ac{dsc} approach. Firstly, the problem of a lack of behavioral research in data analytics is identified. Then, the objectives for a solution are defined through a literature review and the use of requirement engineering to gather requirements for the application. Next, the application is design, implemented prototypically and its functionality demonstrated. Finally, solution is evaluated through the usages of the requirements.
